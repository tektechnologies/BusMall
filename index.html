                <p>Cedar Rapids is a vibrant city, encompassing unique attractions,
                 exciting events, specialty shopping, a dynamic art scene, and a large 
                variety of restaurant and nightlife options. You’ll find that Cedar Rapids
               offers one of the best places to live, work and play in the Midwest.
              Every year the Cedar Rapids community experiences the wonders of changing
             seasons in our Midwestern landscape. Some say that taking the time to appreciate 
             everyday beauty extends life, almost like an extra season is added to every year.
              Cedar Rapids offers a unique balance of big city amenities without all the typical
           hassles and headaches that come with a large city.  This extra time afforded to our
          residents and visitors is why Cedar Rapids is known as “The City of Five Seasons.” 
           This fifth season affords us time to enjoy all other seasons, and to enjoy life.</p>
