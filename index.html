              <p>Cedar Rapids is a vibrant city, encompassing unique attractions,
                 exciting events, specialty shopping, a dynamic art scene, and a large 
                 variety of restaurant and nightlife options. You’ll find that Cedar Rapids
                 offers one of the best places to live, work and play in the Midwest.
                 Every year the Cedar Rapids community experiences the wonders of changing
                 seasons in our Midwestern landscape. Some say that taking the time to appreciate 
                 everyday beauty extends life, almost like an extra season is added to every year.
                 Cedar Rapids offers a unique balance of big city amenities without all the typical
                 hassles and headaches that come with a large city.  This extra time afforded to our
                 residents and visitors is why Cedar Rapids is known as “The City of Five Seasons.” 
                 This fifth season affords us time to enjoy all other seasons, and to enjoy life.
